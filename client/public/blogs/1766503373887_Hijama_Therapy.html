    <h2>What is Hijama (Wet Cupping) Therapy?</h2>
    <p>Hijama, also known as wet cupping therapy, is a traditional healing practice that involves creating suction on the skin using special cups, followed by gentle, controlled incisions to draw out a small amount of blood. This process is believed to remove toxins, improve blood circulation, and promote natural healing in the body.</p>
    <h2>Benefits of Hijama Therapy</h2>

      <li>Reduces inflammation and muscle tension</li>
