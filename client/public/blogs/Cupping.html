    <h2>What is Cupping Therapy?</h2>
    <p>Cupping therapy is an ancient healing technique that uses special cups placed on the skin to create suction. This suction helps increase blood flow, reduce pain and inflammation, and promote relaxation and well-being. At Dukhniwaran Physiotherapy, we use both traditional and modern cupping methods tailored to your needs.</p>
    <h2>Benefits of Cupping Therapy</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Relieves muscle tension and pain</li>
      <li>Improves blood circulation</li>
      <li>Reduces inflammation</li>
      <li>Promotes relaxation and stress relief</li>
      <li>Supports recovery from sports injuries</li>
      <li>May help with headaches, back pain, and more</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How is Cupping Performed?</h2>
    <p>During a session, cups are placed on specific areas of your body. The therapist creates suction using heat or a pump. The cups are left in place for 5-15 minutes. You may feel a gentle pulling sensation, but the process is generally comfortable and relaxing.</p>
    <h2>What to Expect After a Session</h2>
    <p>It’s common to see round marks or mild bruising where the cups were placed. These marks are harmless and usually fade within a few days. Most people feel relaxed and notice reduced pain or tension after their session.</p>
    <h2>Is Cupping Therapy Right for You?</h2>
    <p>Cupping is safe for most people, but it’s important to consult with a qualified physiotherapist to ensure it’s appropriate for your condition. At Dukhniwaran Physiotherapy, we assess your needs and recommend the best treatment plan for you.</p>
