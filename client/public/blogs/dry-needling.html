    <h2>What is Dry Needling?</h2>
    <p>Dry needling is a modern physiotherapy technique that uses thin, sterile needles to target trigger points in muscles. This helps release tightness, reduce pain, and restore normal function. Unlike acupuncture, dry needling is based on Western anatomy and focuses on musculoskeletal pain and dysfunction.</p>
    <h2>Benefits of Dry Needling</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Relieves muscle pain and stiffness</li>
      <li>Improves range of motion and flexibility</li>
      <li>Reduces trigger points and muscle knots</li>
      <li>Speeds up recovery from injuries</li>
      <li>Enhances athletic performance</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How is Dry Needling Performed?</h2>
    <p>Our trained physiotherapists insert fine needles into specific muscle areas. You may feel a brief twitch or mild ache, but the procedure is generally well-tolerated. Sessions are tailored to your needs and may be combined with other therapies for best results.</p>
    <h2>Is Dry Needling Safe?</h2>
    <p>Dry needling is safe when performed by certified professionals. At Dukhniwaran Physiotherapy, we use sterile, single-use needles and follow strict safety protocols. Mild soreness may occur but usually resolves quickly.</p>
    <h2>Who Can Benefit?</h2>
    <p>Dry needling is effective for people with chronic pain, sports injuries, muscle tightness, and limited mobility. We assess your condition to ensure this therapy is right for you.</p>
