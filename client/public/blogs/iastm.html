    <h2>What is IASTM?</h2>
    <p>Instrument-Assisted Soft Tissue Mobilization (IASTM) is a specialized technique that uses ergonomic tools to break down scar tissue, release fascial restrictions, and improve mobility. It is highly effective for treating chronic pain and soft tissue injuries.</p>
    <h2>Benefits of IASTM</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduces pain and muscle tightness</li>
      <li>Breaks down scar tissue and adhesions</li>

      <li>Speeds up recovery from injuries</li>
      <li>Enhances athletic performance</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How is IASTM Performed?</h2>
